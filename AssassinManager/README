The AssassinManager assignment deals with Link List. There are 3 classes I worked on in this assignment, AssassinMain, AssassinManager, and AssassinNode.
The AssassinNode class is used to store the information for one player in the game of assassin. Initially the "killer" field
is set to null, but when the person is killed, this should be set to the name of the killer.
Class AssassinMain is the driver program for the assassin management task. It reads names from a file, shuffles them if the user so desires, and uses
them to start the game.  The user is asked for the name of the next victim until the game is over.
AssassinManager is where the main logic is implemented.
